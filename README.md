# Probabilistic Scoring Lists

Probabilistic scoring lists are incremental models that evaluate one feature of the dataset at a time.
PSLs can be seen as a extension to *scoring systems* in two ways:
- they can be evaluated at any stage allowing to trade of model complexity and prediction speed.
- they provide a probability distribution over scores instead of hard thresholds.

Scoring Systems are used as decision support for human experts in medical or law domains.

This implementation adheres to the [sklearn-api](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/glossary.html#glossary-estimator-types).

# Install
```bash
pip install scikit-psl
```

# Usage

For examples have a look at the `examples` folder, but here is a simple example


```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

from skpsl import ProbabilisticScoringList

# Generating synthetic data with continuous features and a binary target variable
X, y = make_classification(n_informative=10, random_state=42)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=.2, random_state=42)

psl = ProbabilisticScoringList({-1, 1, 2})
psl.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(f"Brier score: {psl.score(X_test, y_test):.4f}")
"""
Brier score: 0.2438  (lower is better)
"""

df = psl.inspect(5)
print(df.to_string(index=False, na_rep="-", justify="center", float_format=lambda x: f"{x:.2f}"))
"""
